SITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!

I'm Juan-Pablo, an electrical engineer originally from Santiago, Chile.

Right now, I'm based in Milan, Italy doing a PhD at the [LASAR](https://www.lasar.polimi.it/) of the [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/). 

Also, I am an Early Stage Researcher (ESR) in [GREYDIENT](https://www.greydient.eu/), a Marie-Curie Innovative Training Network (ITN) in which I collaborate with many universities in Europe.
